## Weekly Report 5 - November 26th, 2023

### Ashley Chen

For the last week, I worked on finishing the ComPass algorithm and receiving the correct output. The problems from last week have been fixed. Then, I worked on integrating this with other members to make it translate back to NL. The code now takes in from the database and outputs it back to another SQL database. I also got started on the presentation.

### Malachi Daniel

I worked with Ashley and Minjae on how to connect the different parts of our project together. Currently, our code is set up in distinct sections and we needed to combine them all together. I gave guidance on how to best extract our code and separate our concerns, so that we can put the pieces of the puzzle together easily.

### Minjae Lee

As requested by Malachi, I have changed the natural language to SQL code so that it is in the form of reusable functions. Additionally we have now come as a group to put the pieces that we have been working on together. Natural Language to SQL, Compass Algorithm, the Databases.

### Yan Konichshev

This week, I have been looking through other people's code in order to have a better understanding of the work that has been done so far. I was reassured that we have all the essential elements to reproduce the experiment in the paper. Additionally, I have started to work on the final presentation and generated a bunch of visualizations for the network.
